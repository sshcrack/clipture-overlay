/*
Concepts:
overlay window - window drawing over all other windows 
source window - window from what content will be taken for overlay window 

Threads: 
All work with overlays in main thread. Node js api called in its own thread. Some communication between thread made by PostThreadMessages. 
Also have mutex to control access to overlays thread data. 
one for changes in list of overlays "overlays_list_access" and each overlay object have own mutex for data what can be accessed by other thread. 

Modes:
Node module. - control by node module api.
